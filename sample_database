I found the path to legend totally unrealistic for the main character. If you not are interested in bandits living in a mountain give this a miss. Finished the book and felt short changed. This has no relation to the Godfather book, so don't buy if that's what you are looking for.\r\n",

He mixes his favourite literate ingredients of love, friendship, honour and betrayal to create a Robin Hood esc tale giving a great incite into the history and culture of the isle of Sicily. A must for any Puzo fan, just don't watch the crummy film, it will ruin your enjoyment.",
